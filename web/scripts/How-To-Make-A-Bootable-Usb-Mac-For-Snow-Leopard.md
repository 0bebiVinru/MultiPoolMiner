Creating a bootable USB drive for Snow Leopard is not very difficult, but it does require some preparation and a few steps. Here is how you can do it:
 
1. First, you need a USB drive that has at least 8 GB of storage space. You also need a Mac that can run Snow Leopard and has a DVD drive.
2. Next, you need to get a copy of the Snow Leopard installation DVD. You can buy it from Apple or borrow it from someone who has it. You can also download it from the Internet, but make sure it is a legitimate and unmodified copy.
3. Then, you need to format your USB drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) using Disk Utility. To do this, plug in your USB drive to your Mac and open Disk Utility from Applications/Utilities. Select your USB drive from the sidebar and click on the Erase tab. Choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the Format menu and give your USB drive a name. Click on Erase and confirm.
4. After that, you need to restore the Snow Leopard installation DVD to your USB drive using Disk Utility. To do this, insert the Snow Leopard DVD into your Mac and open Disk Utility again. Select the DVD from the sidebar and click on the Restore tab. Drag the DVD icon to the Source field and drag your USB drive icon to the Destination field. Click on Restore and confirm.
5. Finally, you need to make your USB drive bootable using Terminal. To do this, open Terminal from Applications/Utilities and type the following command: `sudo bless --folder /Volumes/USB_NAME/System/Library/CoreServices --bootinfo --bootefi` Replace USB\_NAME with the name of your USB drive and press Enter. You will be asked for your administrator password, so type it and press Enter again.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a bootable USB drive for Snow Leopard. To use it, plug it into your Mac and restart it while holding down the Option key. You will see a list of bootable devices, so choose your USB drive and follow the instructions to install or reinstall Snow Leopard.
